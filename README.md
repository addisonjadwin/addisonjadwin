# Addison Jadwin

## Bio
Hello! I'm Addison, a coterm masters student and ML researcher at Stanford. Below are some projects & information demonstrating my experience!



## Projects
- **Improving minBERT MulCtask Performance through In-Domain Pretraining and NRL Learning** - [Link to Project](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369901299_Improving_minBERT_Performance_on_Multiple_Tasks_through_In-domain_Pretraining_Negatives_Ranking_Loss_Learning_and_Hyperparameter_Optimization)
  - In this methodology project, we implemented minBERT, a miniaturized version of BERT with less parameters, and demonstrated practices for improving multitask performance (sentiment analysis, paraphrase detection, and semantic textual similarity) across three different datasets. We improved minBERT embeddings by implementing a recently published loss funciton, Multiple Negatives Ranking Loss Learning, as well as with a masked-language-model task on the datasets, leading to improvements of up to 32% above baseline. 
- **AI Knowledge Navigator** - [Link to Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/120SoBaiETh0RUfio6yt_QHUd-CKgPBZM/view)
  - This is an LLM-powered agent I worked on which allows a user to quickly access and store semantic information across multiple documents. Users can query GPT-4 for desired information, both high-level or low-level, in their documents rather than manually searching for it. We found 4x acceleration compared to human reading speed. My role involved prompt engineering with the LLM to synthesize information from the documents and  backend indexing/storage of this information.
